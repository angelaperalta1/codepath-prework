An app that I'd like to make better would be MyFitnessPal. It's always been diffcult to stick to tracking my meals everyday, so making it into a game (kind of like duolingo) could be fun. Creating incentives to log food everyday, like badges, themes, etc could be a fun feature. Adding the ability to have "friend challenges," to make it easier to stay accountable with your friends. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
